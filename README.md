Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming

## Hello, World!

Python is a interpreted language, so you can run the code directly in the terminal.

```shell
python3 # this will open the python interpreter
```
    (base) com@example ~ % python3
    Python 3.11.5 (main, Sep 11 2023, 08:31:25) [Clang 14.0.6 ] on darwin

### ***Why python3 instead of python?***

There are some reasons to use `python3` instead of `python`. one of them is that `python` is linked to `python2` in some systems.

## Python2

Python2 and Python3 have some differences. 
The most important is in `print` [function](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp). 
In Python2, `print` is a [statement](https://pynative.com/python-statements/), so you don't need to use parentheses.

```python
print "Hello, World!"
```
